        <p>The service is always great, and the atmosphere is very fun and trendy. The food is delicious 
          every time, and I know I can always count on them to get my order correct and assure it's tasty.
          I am a huge fan of their spinach artichoke dip and the enlightened spinach salad, which is pictured.</p>

              <p> I have gone to Jubans for brunch, lunch, and dinner, and they are incredible. From the service to
              the food to the atmosphere, it's a wonderful restaurant. They are on the pricier side, but you will not
              be disappointed. The waiters/waitresses are extremely polite and give impeccable service. Pictured is the 
              Hallelujah Crab.</p>

              <p> This is one of my all-time favorite restaurants! They have a wide variety on their
                menu, and they have a great selection for vegetarians/vegans. They have one of the 
                best happy hours ever: 50% off selected appetizers and drink specials. I most definitely
                recommend! Pictured is the Poke Nachos. </center></p>

              <p> I discovered this doughnut shop on Doordash, and I immediately placed an order. I ordered 
              the $4.99 (6) hot mini doughnuts, and I chose the bananas foster and turtle flavors. By the 
              time it was delivered to me, my doughnuts were lukewarm, but the taste was still delightful.
              The doughnuts were the perfect amount of sweetness, and the flavors vary tremendously. A must 
              try.</p><center>
