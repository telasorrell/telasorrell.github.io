        <p>The service is always great, and the atmosphere is very fun and trendy. The food is delicious 
          every time, and I know I can always count on them to get my order correct and assure it's tasty.
          I am a huge fan of their spinach artichoke dip and the enlightened spinach salad, which is pictured.</p>

              <p> I have gone to Jubans for brunch, lunch, and dinner, and they are incredible. From the service to
              the food to the atmosphere, it's a wonderful restaurant. They are on the pricier side, but you will not
              be disappointed. The waiters/waitresses are extremely polite and give impeccable service. Pictured is the 
              Hallelujah Crab.</p>

            <p> They have a very large menu, which will cater to everyone! Sometimes it can be a bit loud and 
              slow, but the food is always delicious. The employees have always been nice and gave good service. 
              I personally love the crispy crab bites and crispy cauliflower orange chicken style, but most of
              the menu items will not disappoint. Pictured is the Lemon Garlic Shrimp Pasta  .</p>

              <p> My oldest sister and I came to St. Louis to visit my other older sister, and
                we decided to do brunch here. We were enjoying ourselves until a waiter spilled
                an entire tray of drinks on our table, getting our phones and my sister's Tory
                Burch purse soaked. He apologized and quickly cleaned up our table and belongings
                with assistance from two other waiters. We found it very strange that a manager
                never came to apologize for the mishap. We decided to request the manager, and we
                found out that the incident was never even reported. The manager was very sweet, 
                and she decided to comp our bill due to the unfortunate events. Besides the incident
                happening, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was calm and friendly. Even
                though my experience wasn't that great, I would still recommend coming here to eat.

            <p> This is one of my all-time favorite restaurants! They have a wide variety on their
                menu, and they have a great selection for vegetarians/vegans. They have one of the 
                best happy hours ever: 50% off selected appetizers and drink specials. I most definitely
                recommend!Pictured is the Gardein Wings in Flavors Firecracker and Korean.</center></p>

              <p> I discovered this doughnut shop on Doordash, and I immediately placed an order. I ordered 
              the $4.99 (6) hot mini doughnuts, and I chose the bananas foster and turtle flavors. By the 
              time it was delivered to me, my doughnuts were lukewarm, but the taste was still delightful.
              The doughnuts were the perfect amount of sweetness, and the flavors vary tremendously. A must 
              try.</p><center>
